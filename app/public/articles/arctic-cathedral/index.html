<title>Marvel at the Arctic Cathedral</title>
<content>
  <p class="text">The Arctic Cathedral is the work of a Norwegian architect called Jan Inge Hovig and dates from 1965. As a result this is one of the newer cathedrals in the country and is built in a dramatic style.</p>
  <p class="text">The structure is meant to look like large blocks of ice and you will find sparkling mosaics inside as well as the iconic fa√ßade which is made of glass and marked with a large crucifix.</p>
  <p class="text">During the winter time the cathedral is lit up from the outside making it appear even more spectacular.</p>
