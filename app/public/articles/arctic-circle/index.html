<title>Visit the Arctic Circle</title>
<content>
  <p class="text">The Arctic Circle Centre is located in the middle of the Saltfjellet mountains on the E6 highway at an altitude of 670m above sea level.</p>
  <p class="text">The invisible boundary for the Midnight Sun is made visible here with the aid of a marble path and several memorial monuments. There are memorials outside to Yugoslavian and Russian Prisoners of War, while inside there is a souvenir shop, cinema and restaurant. </p>
  <p class="text">Surrounded by the national park the centre is a good starting point for walks.</p>
