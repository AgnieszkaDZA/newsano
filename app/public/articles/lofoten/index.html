<title>Visit the Lofoten Islands</title>
<content>
  <p class="text">While the fjords cut into the land, Lofoten is shaped like a big arm that stretches out in the sea. The many mountain peaks point towards the Arctic sky like church spires, and in between them youâ€™ll find traditional villages full of fishermen and artists.</p> 
  <p class="text">Try everything from local food made of seafood and lamb to beaches of white sand and the Lofotr Viking Museum. It is also easy to travel to the mainland, or to Helgeland and the UNESCO-listed Vega archipelago further south.</p>
